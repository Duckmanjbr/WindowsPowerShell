	- Removing 'config file' option for modules that don't need it;
		most begin blocks for new modules should look like this:
		$scripttime = [Diagnostics.Stopwatch]::StartNew()
        $outputFileName="Enum-Process"
        $ErrorFileNameH,$ErrorFileNameV,$outputFileName = Set-OutandErrorFiles -outputFileName $outputFileName -CSV $CSV -TXT $TXT
	- repaired MD5 Hashing functionality of enum-service and enum-process
	- most common commands are actually object-oriented function calls now
		$obj = $scriptblock | Invoke-RemoteCommand -ComputerArray $ComputerArray
		
		if($obj){
            Out-Custom -object $obj -CSV $CSV -TXT $TXT -outputFileName $outputFileName
        }
