General/design problems to solve
	- too many files
	- too many hard-coded variables
	- no easy button
		- menu driven use (for 852)
	- general buginess
	- lack of full functionality in Laser
	- Lack of compatibility between Laser and Torch
	- Lack of multiple output options
	- Lack of documentation and training
	- Lack of version control
	- over use of global variables
	- the junction, is it necessary?
	- way too much setup in profile.ps1
	- hostsop, or something like it, needs to be a function
	- it doesn't work on linux
	- compatibility issues with powershell 4.0
	- memory leaks
	- speed issues
		- P_solution: add true multithreading
	- external calls in host-sop to enable winrm
	- more object orientedness
	- lack of accurate help
		- can I get someone else to do this?
	- lack of comments
		- fml
	- error handling
		
	
Specific Problems to solve

	- forced name resolution?
		- is there a way to manually set the server to the DCIP for resolution? Probably
	- forced credential verification
	- Flexible IOC search capability
	- Multi-threading capability
	- make a hostsop function
	- weird double transcript bug (powershell 5 unique?)
		fixed
	- when a host is no longer resolvable, scripts fail, but don't tell you why
	
IRAT
1. Identify Rogue Processes 
	- Data Collection
		- enum-processes (executable name, parent process, path, cmdline, starttime, priority, user, hash?)
	- Analysis
		- LFO (manual/pivot tables)
		- LFO (automatic/Splunk)
		- DFIR Poster(Splunk)
			- Valid path
			- Valid parent
			- Valid cmdline options
			- Valid starttime
			- Valid user
	
2. Analyze Process DLLs and handles
	- Data Collection
		-
	- Analysis

3. Review Network Artefacts
	- Data Collection
		- enum-netstat
	- Analysis
		- LFO (manual)
		- LFO (Splunk)
		
4. Look for evidence of code injection
	- Data Collection
		- Armament (?)
		- memory scrape
		- memgrep
		- antibody
	- Analysis

6. Dump suspicious processes and Drivers
	- Data Collection
		- copy \\$computer\C$\path_to_proc .
		- enum-driver
	- Analysis
		- Strings
		- Bonepicker
		- IDA

**7. Look for evidence of lateral movement
	- Data Collection
		- Network logons from other hosts on the network
		- pass the hash detection
		
	- Analysis
		- manual/splunk
		
**8. Look for evidence of persistence
	- Data Collection
		- Registry
